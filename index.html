        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>HTML is responsible for the "what" that is in a website. The words, images, and layout are all HTML.</li>
          <li>The head element contains info about the webpage. This is invisible to the user.</li>
          <li>The meta element contains info about the webpage, and is what is housed in the head element listed above. This is also invisible to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element conatins the information that is presented to the user. This is the "website" that the user interacts with.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when you want style elements directly in the HTML file. You apply the CSS directly to specific HTML tags. This is useful for quick, permenant changes, but can be less felxible due to editing needing to happen on an individual basis.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheets apply CCS to the whole page, but only that page. To use, you put the style designation in the head element. A single change to the CSS rule changes all tagged elements.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheets are the most common method of applying CSS to a webpage. To use, you link a seperate file. This adheres to the Seperation of Concerns coding principle: every section of code has its own responsibility.</li>
