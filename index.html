        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>HTML is responsible for the "what" that is in a website. The words, images, and layout are all HTML.</li>
          <li>The head element contains info about the webpage. This is invisible to the user.</li>
          <li>The meta element contains info about the webpage, and is what is housed in the head element listed above. This is also invisible to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element conatins the information that is presented to the user. This is the "website" that the user interacts with.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when you want style elements directly in the HTML file. You apply the CSS directly to specific HTML tags. This is useful for quick, permenant changes, but can be less felxible due to editing needing to happen on an individual basis.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheets apply CCS to the whole page, but only that page. To use, you put the style designation in the head element. A single change to the CSS rule changes all tagged elements.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheets are the most common method of applying CSS to a webpage. To use, you link a seperate file. This adheres to the Seperation of Concerns coding principle: every section of code has its own responsibility.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that allows developers to store their code, work from different computers, work in tandem with other developers without overlap, track versions, projects, etc.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a webpage that almost acts as a social media platform for sharing and viewing projects, as well as a repository system for coding projects, provides a workflow system, etc for developers.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git checkout main: switches you to the main branch</li>
          <li>git add -A: stage your changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "note regarding changes": commits files to working branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic programming language that adds interactivity to websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows you to store data in your code.</li>
          <li>const: allows you to create a variable, but you cannot reassign the data. This is the preferred method of naming variables.</li>
          <li>if: introduces decision making into code. Only executes code if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>falsy: 0, -0, " ", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean with a value of false.</li>
          <li>truthy: all other values.</li>
          <li>=== called the strict equality operator, checks to see if two values are equal, returns either true or false.</li>
          <li>array: a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, generally related.</li>
          <li>index: to get to one item in an array, an index is corrected. Always starts with 0.</li>
          <li>for: uses predictable patterns in indices to perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>let: assign data to a variable, but unlike cont, allows value reassignment over time.</li>
          <li>function: a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. Functions do not automatically run, but are helpful because you can call them when you need them.</li>
