# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project serves as a study guide for the information covered in the prework portion of the UNC coding bootcamp. By creating this guide, I have created a database for all of the information covered. By building it myself, I was able to use the knowledge I gained, thus reinforcing the lessons.

## Usage

This guide can be used like a journal, as it can be added to as new information is gathered. It's main purpose, however, is to act as a point of reference for what was learned before classes began, and to act as a reminder of the lessons contained within the prework. This guide contains sections for JavaScript, Git, HTML, and CSS, while also providing example code for the topics within once opened in the DevTools console.
